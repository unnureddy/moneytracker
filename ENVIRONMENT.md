# Environment Variables Configuration

This file documents the environment variables needed for the MoneyTracker application.

## Development Environment

For local development, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (this file is gitignored):

```bash
# React App Environment Variables
REACT_APP_ENV=development

# AWS Configuration (Optional for local development)
# These will be auto-generated when you run 'amplify init'
# REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# REACT_APP_USER_POOL_ID=your-user-pool-id
# REACT_APP_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
# REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=your-api-endpoint
```

## Production Environment

For production deployment on AWS Amplify, environment variables are configured through:

1. **AWS Amplify Console**:
   - Go to your app in Amplify Console
   - Navigate to "Environment variables" section
   - Add variables as needed

2. **Auto-generated by Amplify**:
   - Most configuration is handled automatically via `aws-exports.js`
   - This file is generated during `amplify push` and contains all AWS resource configurations

## Important Notes

- **Never commit** `.env.local` or `aws-exports.js` to version control
- These files are already included in `.gitignore`
- For team collaboration, share environment variable names only, not values
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive production data

## AWS Exports File

After running `amplify init` and `amplify push`, you'll get an `aws-exports.js` file that looks like:

```javascript
const awsmobile = {
    "aws_project_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_cognito_identity_pool_id": "us-east-1:xxxxx",
    "aws_cognito_region": "us-east-1",
    "aws_user_pools_id": "us-east-1_xxxxx",
    "aws_user_pools_web_client_id": "xxxxx",
    "aws_cloud_logic_custom": [
        {
            "name": "transactionapi",
            "endpoint": "https://xxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev",
            "region": "us-east-1"
        }
    ]
};

export default awsmobile;
```

This file is automatically imported in your application to configure AWS services.
